## Deployment

All web applications in this suite are ready for deployment on [Render.com](https://render.com/). Each project contains a `requirements.txt` and a standard Flask entry point (`app.py`). To deploy:

1. Push the desired project folder to a separate GitHub repository (or keep as subfolders).
2. Connect your repository to Render.com.
3. Set the build and start commands as required (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `python app.py`).
4. Configure environment variables if needed.

## Future Roadmap

- **Phase 2:** Integrate backend logic and connect to databases for dynamic content management.
- **Phase 3:** Incorporate AI tools such as chatbots, recommendation systems, and automation features.
- Add comprehensive test suites for all applications.
- Enhance UI/UX with modern frameworks and design systems.
- Expand documentation and add user guides.
